This node is a type unknown to your installation of Node-RED.

_If you deploy with the node in this state, it's configuration will be preserved, but the flow will not start until the missing type is installed._

It is possible this node type is already installed, but is missing a dependency. Check the Node-RED start-up log for any error messages associated with the missing node type. Use **npm install <module>** to install any missing modules and restart Node-RED and reimport the nodes.

Otherwise, you should contact the author of the flow to obtain a copy of the missing node type.
